# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?

I feel pretty confident with my understanding of the comparison operators, but still sometimes forget the ==.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?

I feel confident in my understanding and fluency with the && and || logical operators. I understand when and how to use them.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?

I feel confident in creating if statements, but am definitely still learning some of the methods called for the if statements (i.e. using modulo, even/odd, etc.).

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?

I estimated about an hour for this activity before previewing the different parts. It took me 2 hours, so definitely more time than I originally thought.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to learn methods that can be used with integers. I plan to spend some time before mod 1 reviewing ruby-doc.org and playing around with the methods.

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

My questions revolve mostly around the different methods you can apply to integers and strings. I'll be using ruby-doc.org as well as Google to help me get answers.
